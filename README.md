## Requirements
- [Alan Wake 2 Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/alanwake2/mods/19) by praydog2

**Please read the instructions on how to install mod loader.**

## Installation
Unzip your mod and copy `data` folder or `data_pc` folder or both and paste them where your Alan Wake 2 game folder is.

Example: `...\Epic Games\AlanWake2\mod_folder_here`

## Removal
To remove the mod delete the `data_pc` folder or in the case of data folder, open `data` and delete **materials** folder. You may want to remove just one mod/retexture which you can by going through a few folders and delete the `*.tex` or `*.material` files directly.

## Troubleshooting
It's high unlikely, but should you encounter issues beyond deletion of the files you can try verifying your game files through Epic.

1. Go to your games library
2. Look for three dots where your game is and click it
3. Select "Manage" and click "Verify."
